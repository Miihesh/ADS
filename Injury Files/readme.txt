Included are two files:

ScrapedMinutes.csv
TransfermarktInjuries.tsv

PlayerMinutes contains information about how much time on the pitch and at which position the player played from Soccerway.
Injuries contains the start and end date of injuries and a description of the injury according to Transfermarkt. 

Given this data, write a small report that you would present to the High Performance Department about anything interesting you
 find about the relationship between playing on short rest and injuries (injuries can also be broken down into soft tissue versus non-soft tissue).
  Short rest can be thought of as when you do not have a full week's rest (for example when there is a midweek match). 
A soft tissue injury is typically a muscle or ligament injury and is thought to be somewhat preventable, as opposed to a contact injury, like a broken leg,
 which is harder to prevent. 


Please include all code and any supporting files in addition to the report.  I am available for answering any questions that might arise.
